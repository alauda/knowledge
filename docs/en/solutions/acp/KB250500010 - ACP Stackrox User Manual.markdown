# ACP Security User Manual

## Overview
ACP adopts StackRox to implement its security features. StackRox provides comprehensive security capabilities for containers and Kubernetes, covering areas such as vulnerability management, runtime security, compliance checks, infrastructure security, network security, and incident response. This document outlines several common security scenarios and how to address them using StackRox. Since ACS (Advanced Cluster Security) already offers well-documented guidance for StackRox, this document will frequently reference the ACS documentation.

## Functionality Classification and Scenarios

### 1. Vulnerability Management
**Function Description**: Scans container images, nodes, and Kubernetes components to identify and manage vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs), supporting security checks during build and deploy phases.

**Supported Scenarios**:
- **Scenario 1: Image Security**

- **Scenario 1.1: Scan Container Images for CVEs and Malware Before Deployment**
  - **Description**: Scan container images before deploying to ensure no critical or high vulnerabilities.
  - **Expected Result**: Images are free of critical/high vulnerabilities, safe for deployment.
  - **Operational Steps**:
    1. **Configure Build Policies**:
       - [Create Vulnerability Policy](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_advanced_cluster_security_for_kubernetes/4.7/html/operating/managing-security-policies#con-policy-categories_about-security-policies)
    2. **Ensure Registry Integration**:
       - Go to **Platform Configuration → Integrations**.
       - Under "Image Integration," check if your registry is integrated.
       - If not, configure manually.

- **Scenario 1.2: Scan Images Directly Using roxctl**
  - **Description**: Use the roxctl CLI tool to scan container images in CI/CD pipelines and obtain immediate vulnerability scan results.
  - **Expected Result**: Quickly retrieve vulnerability information for images for manual inspection or other automated processes.
  - **Operational Steps**:
    1. **Ensure roxctl is Installed**:
       - Refer to [Installing the roxctl CLI](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_advanced_cluster_security_for_kubernetes/4.7/html-single/roxctl_cli/index) to install roxctl.
    2. **Configure Authentication**:
       - Generate an API token: In the Stackrox portal, navigate to **Platform Configuration → Integrations** and generate an API token.
       - Export the token: `export ROX_API_TOKEN=<api_token>`
       - Export the central address: `export ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS=<central_address>`
    3. **Scan the Image**:
       - Use the command: `roxctl image scan --image=<image_registry>/<image_name>`
       - Example: `roxctl image scan --image=docker.io/library/nginx:latest`
    4. **Parse Scan Results**:
       - Scan results are output in JSON format, including details of components and vulnerabilities in the image.
    5. **Check the policy**:
       - Use the command: `roxctl image check --image=docker.io/library/nginx:latest`
       - [Check the policy](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_advanced_cluster_security_for_kubernetes/4.7/html-single/roxctl_cli/index#checking-deployment-yaml-files_checking-policy-compliance)

- **Scenario 1.3: Generate SBOM to Ensure Software Supply Chain Security**
  - **Description**: Generate a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for container images to get a detailed overview of all software components, dependencies, and libraries.
  - **Expected Result**: Users can generate and analyze SBOMs to ensure compliance with supply chain security standards (e.g., NIST Executive Order).
  - **Operational Steps**:
    1. **Scan the Image**:
       - Go to Vulnerability Management  Results and locate the image.
    2. **View SBOM**:
       - Navigate to the image details page in the Stackrox portal to view the generated SBOM.
    3. **Export SBOM**:
       - Download the SBOM for further analysis or compliance purposes.
    4. **Generate SBOM with cli**:
       - Use the command: `roxctl image sbom --image=docker.io/library/nginx:latest > sbom.json`
  - **ACS Documentation Link**: [Generating SBOMs](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_advanced_cluster_security_for_kubernetes/4.7/html/operating/managing-vulnerabilities#sbom-generate_scanner-generate-sbom)

- **Scenario 1.4: Ensure Only Signed and Verified Images Are Deployed**

         - Host IPC
         - Privileged Container
         - Privilege Escalation
         - Writable Host Mount
       - Set lifecycle stage to "Deploy" or "Runtime."
       - Enable enforcement.
    2. **Test the Policies**:
       - Deploy a container with HostNetwork enabled.

  - **Expected Result**: No undetected anomalous activities, with alerts generated for policy violations.
  
  - **Operational Steps**:
    1. **Configure Runtime Security Policies**:
       - Go to **Platform Configuration → Policy Management**.
       - Enable runtime policies, such as detecting privileged command execution or network scanning.

    2. **Set Up Automatic Responses**:
       - Configure response methods in the policies, such as automatically stopping or deleting affected Pods.
    3. **Test the Policies**:
       - Simulate suspicious behavior in a test environment and verify that the policies correctly detect and respond.
    4. **Monitor and Review**:
