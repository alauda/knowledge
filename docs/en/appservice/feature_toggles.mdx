# Feature Gate Configuration \{#feature_toggles}

## Overview

You can customize which features are enabled or disabled on the platform through the Web Console. Feature gates allow you to control whether functionality is visible in the Web Console or how the corresponding APIs behave. Whether a gate only affects UI visibility or also changes API behavior depends on the implementation of each specific feature gate. For detailed information, please refer to the documentation for each feature.

## Procedure

### Accessing the Feature Gate Page

Access the feature gates at `{platform-access-address}/console-platform/feature-gate`. For example, if your platform access address is `https://demo.example.com/console-portal/`, the feature gate page would be `https://demo.example.com/console-platform/feature-gate`.

### Disabling All Alpha Features

To disable all Alpha features platform-wide:
1. Navigate to the "Stage Setting" section
2. Turn off the "Alpha Feature" gate

Beta features can be similarly managed through the Stage Setting section.

### Enabling Specific Features for a Single Cluster

To enable specific features for an individual cluster:
1. Find the gate list with the display name of your target cluster as its title
2. Enable the specific features you need in that list

### Disabling Specific Features Globally

To disable specific features across all clusters:
1. Go to the "System Settings" section
2. Turn off the gates for the features you want to disable globally
